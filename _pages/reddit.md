## Classifying Reddit posts by subreddit
Reddit is a social media platform with a large user base and organized online communities. r/BlackPeopleTwitter and r/WhitePeopleTwitter are two such communities that are both relatively popular and contain similar content. In both of these communities, or subreddits, users post screenshots of individual tweets from Twitter and other users comment on them. This project takes the post title and top comment from thousands of posts and classifier them according to the language that they use.
