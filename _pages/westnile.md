## Predicting West Nile  
Machine learning can help make more informed decisions when the stakes&mdash;whether monetary or human&mdash;are too high to leave to a hunch. This project uses data provided by Kaggle to predict the probability of West Nile virus appearing in Chicago. Given where mosquitos with West Nile were caught in odd-numbered years, along with weather data, could our team predict where mosquitos would appear in even-numbered years?

### Results
We built a model that assigned a probability of finding West Nile to each trap on each day. Our probabilities could be used by decision makers to decide when to take action&mdash;spray the area or warn residents&mdash;when the probability of West Nile passed whatever threshold they might feel is critical.
