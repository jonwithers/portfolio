intro:
  - excerpt: 'With degrees in physics and music, I combine qualitative insights and mathematical rigor to answer big questions.  During my graduate work in ethnomusicology, I cultivated a love of studying the overlooked and making the unknown understandable. As a teacher, I love the challenges that come with communicating complex ideas. I want to connect people to information in ways that feel like discoveries.'
